# Cybersecurity Resources
Please feel free to share this list of resources or make recommendations for additions. Reach me at jellyphish95@protonmail.com for questions or addition recommendations.

	- No Pricing information available...
	- It's an ok platform if your employer is paying for it, but it's pricey for an individual.

### Video Based

**UDEMY**: https://www.udemy.com/
- All different styles of content for cyber or other IT courses available, make sure you get ones that are up to date! They have often have content on sale, and what's great about it, NO SUBSCRIPTIONS! You buy the course at the price and have unlimited access to it, YAY!

**Cybrary**: https://www.cybrary.it/
- Video courses and hands-on components through virtual labs. Seems pretty straightforward, I have not used it myself, but someone recommended it to me and said they liked it better than Rangeforce...
- Pricing: https://www.cybrary.it/upgrade
	- Free Basic Access
	- $59 / month billed monthly
	- $49 / month billed annually

**COURSERA**: https://www.coursera.org/
- Interesting concept, seemingly affordable. They give you a 7-day full access free trial and they do state financial aid is available!
- After the free trial, it's $49 / month or $399 / year to continue learning.
- You can also purchase individual courses but must complete within 180 days: https://www.coursera.support/s/article/208280146-Pay-for-a-course-or-Specialization?language=en_US
- Financial Aid: https://www.coursera.support/s/article/209819033-Apply-for-Financial-Aid-or-a-Scholarship?language=en_US
	- They also mention additional help might be available through the American Dream Academy: https://theamericandreamacademy.org/
	- https://theamericandreamacademy.org/assets/TheAmericanDreamAcademy_Pathways.pdf

**IT Pro TV**: https://www.itpro.tv/plans/personal/
- Free (very) limited version, you don't get a lot of the heavier stuff, it's like how to use PPT and Word :( I assume the free stuff is really more to demo the style of teaching I guess. They have a lot of cert courses in the premium version, but I recommend just buying the certification study guide and supplementing with free Youtube courses or other one-time paid resources as needed, etc.

**YOUTUBE**: https://www.youtube.com/ 
- I challenge you to find the cyber channels and content creators, that work for you, some are more structured than others!
- I personally don't really use Youtube unless I am trying to find a specific "how-to ..." for something.
- I prefer a book or interactive online learning platform.

**Pluralsight**: https://www.pluralsight.com/
- I wouldn't bother, it has a 10 day and 200 min free trial and then it's 299$ / year or 29$ / month, if you don't cancel before the 10 day trial. 

**LinkedIn Learning**: https://www.linkedin.com/learning/
- It's free for a month. Then there are some free courses available with Premium... I think. Mostly I have found these courses good for general review or quick refresh before an interview! 
- Always check if your employer or college has a LinkedIn Learning license available for you, don't miss out. Most places I have worked offer it, and my school did as well, back when it was Lynda Learning.

## Conferences

Concise AC does a pretty good job of keeping up with the available conferences around the world: https://infosec-conferences.com/

Have a conference you run that needs to be posted, let them know: it's FREE! 
https://infosec-conferences.com/submission/

Go to conferences and meet folks, network in real life. Most of the smaller regional conferences like Bsides are very low cost, even free sometimes!  

### Organization Based

- ISC^2: https://www.isc2.org/professional-development/events
- IEEE: https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2023/
- CompTIA: https://connect.comptia.org/channelcon?sfredirect=/channelcon
- Security Bsides Series: http://www.securitybsides.com/w/page/12194156/FrontPage
	- Just a note on their main site: it's not totally up to date, since Bsides conferences are held regionally, you might have more success finding a local Bsides conference by just searching "bsides" + " city you're in".
- SchmooCon: https://www.shmoocon.org/
  
### Independently Owned

- ICS Cybersecurity Conference by SecurityWeek: https://www.icscybersecurityconference.com/

### Vendor Sponsored

- Q: Vendors, what in the world are those? 
- A: Think companies that supply security services or tools to other companies.

## In-Person Meetups

### DC Groups
Find more info at https://forum.defcon.org/social-groups

>**Q: What are DEF CON Groups (DCGs)?**  
>A: The DEF CON Groups were spawned from the annual DEF CON security conference in Las Vegas. The DEF CON Groups (DCGs or DC-Groups) are a gathering point for folks interested in the alternate applications of modern technology, referred to properly as 'hacking'. DCGs are not intended to compete with any other computer groups, such as 2600, but rather to provide yet another gathering place for the discussion of technology and security topics. DCG meetings are open to anyone, regardless of their skill, age, job, gender, etc. DCGs are designed to help you learn new things, meet new people, mentor others in areas you may be strong in, and provide some cohesion within the hacker culture and it's members.

## Certifications

### Vendor Neutral
In general, vendor neutral certification do not align or teach you how to use any specific security tool or appliance. In studying for the certification, the goal is to familiarize yourself with the general principles of security for various elements of IT or for cybersecurity program management. 

Vendor Neutral certs focus on the "WHY" and the "Administrative-HOW" for implementing security.

**ISC^2 - International Information Security Certification Consortium, Inc**
>From our first days in 1989 at the dawn of the internet age, a small forward-looking group of information security professionals recognized, before all others, the role that security would play in the rapid adoption of innovative new technologies. They established the International Information System Security Certification Consortium, Inc. (ISC2) to nurture an emerging new profession with the expertise, standards and ethical practices necessary to secure our economies, nations and personal lives.

Check out their family of certs: https://www.isc2.org/Certifications
- They go from Entry-level to Advanced.
	- The certifications have work experience requirements associated with their expected level of expertise, with the exception of Certified in Cyber. So even if you pass the exam, you need to have some work experience. If you pass the test, but don't have the experience you are classed as an Associate of ISC^2.
	- SSCP requires at least 1 year in 1 / 7 domains, CISSP requires 5 years in 2 / 8 domains, etc
	- All certs except CC, meet U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) Directive 8570.1.
	- All certs are ANAB Accredited and meet ISO/IEC Standard 17024.
- Once you become a ISC^2 member, pass your first exam, pay fees etc, they provide a discount on training: https://www.isc2.org/landing/mem20off
- But you can find alternative training for FREE or PAID elsewhere for certain courses, for example:
	- FRSecure CISSP Mentor Program: https://frsecure.com/cissp-mentor-program/

**Certified in Cyber** - Free Entry-Level Program (For Limited Time), 1 Million CC Goal
https://www.isc2.org/landing/1mcc
- Free online course (14 hours of training)
- Once you complete the online course, they provide a voucher code so you can take the exam.
- Caveats:
	- Course access is restricted to 180 days.
	- Only 1 exam voucher will be provided, if you fail, you'll need to pay for the second take.
	- You must be 16 years old to sit for an ISC2 examination.
Maintenance Requirements for CC:
- Certified in Cybersecurity credential holders will need to earn 45 CPE credits during their three-year certification cycle to maintain the certification. We recommend earning 15 credits per year. You will also need to pay an Annual Maintenance Fee to maintain your certification.
- The Annual Maintenance Fee (AMF) for Certified in Cybersecurity is U.S. $50. This is due upon certification and annually upon your certification anniversary.

### Vendor Specific
Vendor specific certifications will verify you have a certain level of technical knowledge using the platform or tool that it was created for.

## Purposeful Social Media

### LinkedIn
https://www.linkedin.com/
A great place to showcase your talents! You don't have to post, but it's a good place to hang out and listen to what others are saying. It's almost exclusively professional, work-related content.

### X (Twitter)
https://x.com/ (https://twitter.com/)
Partake at your own risk...
There ~~is~~ was a lot of infosec folks on Twitter. There still are to some extent people milling about there, commenting on things, X has always been a mixed bag of professional and personal posting. 

### Discord
https://discord.com/
Great platform for meeting people all with a specific purpose in mind, like for security conferences, or for maker space groups. Recently re-fired up my Discord and made it meaningful by joining groups for DEFCON, DC groups in ATL, and for conferences I've been attending, plus CTF's. So definitely recommend, if you don't already, make sure and try the Discords (if they're offered).

### Mastodon 
https://mastodon.social/explore, https://mastodon.social/about
Thoughts: Not familiar with this platform, reminds me of the BBS system... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system. I do WANT to explore it, I just haven't had the time. It's on the 'eventual' list for sure though.

If you are on Mastodon, then be sure to check out Infosec.exchange to network with security professionals or enthusiasts: https://infosec.exchange/explore

## Try Obsidian

What is Obsidian you ask? 
>Obsidian is the private and flexible writing app that adapts to the way you think.
>https://obsidian.md/ 

Story Time, curtains up! \*jazz plays\*

**Act 1:** 
I fell in love with Markdown during my second cybersecurity internship and have not looked back since. I needed a way to quickly categorize information I was accumulating in the process of fixing the *very* broken tool I had been tasked with "installing". 

I knew about Markdown formatting from Github README's and wanted to bring it outside the platform. In the end, I was able to beautifully document the tool, and create a README / user guide to help them manage the tool after I left. 

**Act 2:** 
A close friend recommended I try Obsidian. I however did not **IMMEDIATELY** go try it out, to my deep and eternal regret!

Months later, I attended DEFCON, had a blast, and was again recommended Obsidian by someone else. This time I did try it out, and was absolutely floored. Why had I not tried it sooner?! I was and am still ashamed of myself... \**sobs in corner*\*

**Act 3:** 
Post-DEFCON I was very motivated, and got right to work on a few high priority projects.
- Building my website: https://jellyphish.io
- Fixing my server
- Powering up to take more certs
- Reviewing "Linux Basics for Hackers" by OTW
- Building this talk for JawnCon!

**Act 4:**
While I was using Obsidian for note taking, I had not fully explored it's wondrous capabilities. More regret, more shame, more sobbing and head shaking... I discovered too late you can launch your blog direct to the web for as little as $8 / month with Publish.
https://obsidian.md/publish 

In closing, lose no time, have no shame, try Obsidian today.
